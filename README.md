# MemoSen-Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository presents a multimodal sentiment analysis framework for Bengali memes, integrating visual and textual representations through deep vision–language fusion. The system is designed to address the cultural, linguistic, and stylistic challenges of sentiment understanding in low-resource Bengali meme content.

The proposed model is evaluated on the MemoSen dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over pretrained vision–language baselines.
